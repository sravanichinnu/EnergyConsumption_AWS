# Energy Consumption Forecasting – End-to-End ML Pipeline on AWS

### Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end energy consumption forecasting system using real-world PJM Interconnection data.
It demonstrates the full lifecycle of a production-grade ML solution — from raw data ingestion to model training, evaluation, visualization, and monitoring — all built on AWS cloud services.

The goal is to accurately forecast hourly electricity demand and analyze prediction errors over time to assess model reliability.
